# React + Vite Contact Support Page

This template offers a minimal setup to get React working seamlessly with Vite, featuring Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and integrated ESLint rules for code quality. 
## About
This project is a React-based single-page design focused on creating an interactive and user-friendly "Contact Us" form. It allows users to connect via support chat, phone, or email by submitting their details through a responsive form.

## Official Plugins

Two official plugins are available to enhance your development experience:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh, ensuring a smooth development process.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Leverages [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh, providing a faster alternative.

This setup allows you to focus on building your contact support page efficiently while enjoying the benefits of modern tooling.
